Description: This package performs prediction of intrinsic cyclizability of of every 50-bp subsequence in a DNA sequence. The input could be a file either in FASTA or text format. The output will be the C-score, the estimated intrinsic cyclizability score for each 50 bp sequences in each entry of the sequence set.
